# Weather Application in NextJS :partly_sunny: :sun_behind_small_cloud:

Weather Application using NextJS, ChakraUI, and Cypress.

## Why did you make this?

It is based off of an existing project in my GitHub the "Weather-App". This is my take on it with much of the materials and concepts I've learned while building my portfolio. Another reason is also because I was instructed to it as a basis for a take-home assignment. Little to my knowledge and the interviewer's, I already completed the take-home (yay!) :grin: :grin: .

## Getting Started

### Dont forget to npm install!!

```
npm install
```

### To run the project and demo it yourself run: :running: :running:

```
npm run dev
```

### Using the UI

- Initially the page will start on the search via City pretty basic :P
- You can toggle the switch button to change it to Coordinates to make it a little spicy
- In the Coordinates page, a user can input their Zip/PostCode and Country Code [(ISO 3166)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)

- The Search should spit out the lat & long below which can be used to input in the coordinates for a search

### Checkout the Cypress Tests like this:

```
npm run cypress
```

- Click E2E Testing
- Choose your preferred browser then click "Start E2E testing in..."
- Make sure Specs is selected in the sidebar, and click on the "app.cy.ts" to run tests

Enjoy the epicness!

NOTE: If the server isn't running already, the tests will fail right away!
